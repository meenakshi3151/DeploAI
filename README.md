## 🧠 Introduction:

AutoDeploy AI is a beginner-friendly deployment platform that eliminates the complexity of DevOps. Just paste your GitHub repo link and our AI will generate the Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline, README.md, basic unit tests, and even debug your build errors. It also supports secure deployment with NGINX, HTTPS, and smart rollbacks.
